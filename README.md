# Kuali Rice Training

Contains exercises, presentations, and manuals for various [Kuali Rice](http://rice.kuali.org)-related trainings that I have conducted over the years. Enjoy :)

## Using

Each training project folder has a date based on when it was created and includes a number of exercises along with documents for the training class. The documents can be found in the ```training-docs``` directory of each folder. The most recent is from July 2013 and is based on Kual Rice version 2.2.1.

The modules of Kuali Rice covered within these training projects include:

* Kuali Enterprise Workflow (KEW)
* Kuali Identity Management (KIM)
* Kuali Enterprise Notification (KEN)
* Kuali Service Bus (KSB)
* Kuali Rule Management System (KRMS)
